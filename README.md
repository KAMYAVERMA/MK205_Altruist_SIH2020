## PS DETAILS

**Ministry/Organization Name** - Ministry of Rural Development 

**Problem Statement** - Making websites meaningful for differently Abled citizens with open source tools.


## UNDERSTANDING THE PROBLEM STATEMENT

- Ministry of Rural Development is currently running several schemes and programs primarily focusing on the development of rural poor. It is important to note that as per census 2011 (2016 updated) â€“ In India out of the 121 Cr population, 2.68 Cr persons are disabled and  (69%) of the disabled population resided in rural areas (1.86 Cr). One more key concern is that around 51% of the total disabled population in rural areas is not literate. 

- It thus becomes important that websites be made compliant towards the requirements that cater to needs of the differently abled citizens to bridge the huge talent leakage it might be causing. 

- Features to be introduced in website that empathise and synchronize with the rural audience and how they can enjoy the benefits with even minimal Digital Literacy.

## SOLUTION

We will be creating a Landing page which will distribute our audience and it will lead to different sections specific to a disability. We have identified and worked for some of the common disabilities possible in a person to make their Web experience more accessible, smoother and easier.

**1. Visually Impaired :**
- Speech to Command for easier website traversal.
- Graphics that support color blindness.
- Audio Recorded messages for traversal throughout website.

**2. Tetra Amelia :**
- Real smooth UI/UX for the people suffering from Tetra Amelia
- Speech to Command facility for the website traversal
- Audio Recorded messages for more accessible website experience.
- Voice-Assisted Video Chat
- Head and Eye Tracking [WIP}

**3.  Speech impaired/Hearing Impaired :** 
- Creating an interactive model based on the HamBurg Notation and SiGML implementation.
- Sign language keyboard for sending and receiving messages [WIP}
- Sign language instruction / illustration helping in traversal of the Website.
- Communication with Government Officials. 
       
**4. Dementia :**
- Visual Imagery for easier selection and traversal through website
- An extremely simple and easy to use website for easier synchronization with the brain.                               
   
**5.** A **chat room** shall also be developed which shall completely work on the sign language and      
speech synthesis.
